# Tic Tac Toe

This Tic Tac Toe game is the project zero for my Web Development study at General Assembly. I hope you enjoy it.

## Background

After two weeks' study of JavaScript, jQuery, HTML & CSS, this is a fun project to test what I've learnt so far and learn more during the game building.

## How to view app

- Link to the game: https://gingernutter.github.io/wdi16_project_zero_tictactoe/
- clone / for my repo: https://github.com/gingernutter/wdi16_project_zero_tictactoe.git (and open src/index.html in your browser)

## Features

- Select your favorite role from 'The Matrix'.
- Two player mode.
- Single player mode. You against the Oracle ('AI'). Unfortunately my 'AI' is an 'Artificial Idiot' at the moment which is very easy to get bitten. After clicking the Oracle button, 'AI' mode is switched on. Simply select your role and start playing against the Oracle.
- Background music can be paused with a toggle button in the top right corner.

## Usage

- Applied CSS, JavaScript and jQuery for styling and user interface;
- Used arrays, objects, functions and loops for basic role selecting logic and winning logic;
- Attached multiple click events handlers;
- Built a simple test (four TicTacToe scenarios) to track the score system;
- Implemented an 'AI' mode.

## Technology

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- jQuery

## Libraries/Plugins

- jQuery
- SweetAlert (a jQuery plugin I used for tie alerts)

## Bugs

- if AI is selected and then the player presses the new round button before playing the first round, the AI will make the initial move and the second move simultaneously only after the player selects a tile.
